## Portfolio
My name is Maciej. I found my passion for testing at the "Software Tester" course, where I gained the necessary knowledge in this field and learned the Scrum method. I have knowledge of ISTQB. I am currently developing myself through webinars and courses. In my free time, I independently learn the basics of the Python language, read about new technology and practice deepwork.
